# Overview

### This project provides solutions for calculating the factorial in two different ways: iteratively and recursively. Additionally, it includes a demonstration of using a library to measure the execution time of the code.

# Iterative Approach
### In this section, we employ a loop to iteratively calculate the factorial.

# Recursive Solution

### The recursive approach uses a function calling itself to calculate the factorial.

# Execution Time Measurement

### To measure the execution time by using sys/time.h library.
